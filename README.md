![Clinical Trials Dashboard](clinical-trials-dashboard.png)

### Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes global clinical trial data using Python and Tableau.  
The dataset was obtained from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (via Kaggle, 2025).  
It explores how research activity varies by study phase, enrollment size, status, sponsor, and medical condition.

---

### Objectives
- Clean and standardize raw clinical trial data using Python and pandas.
- Identify key insights such as:
  - Which trial phases have the most studies.
  - How participant enrollment changes across phases.
  - The most common medical conditions studied.
  - The top sponsors conducting trials.
- Create an interactive Tableau dashboard for clear, data-driven storytelling.
